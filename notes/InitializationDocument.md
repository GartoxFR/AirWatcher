## Introduction

The objective of this lab is to apply software engineering courses to develop a software application. This application, called AirWatcher, will provide to a government agency for environmental protection a monitoring tool for their air quality sensors, spread over the territory. Throughout the different lab sessions, our team will have to specify the different requirements, design the architecture of the application, and develop some parts of the software.
